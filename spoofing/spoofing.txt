When a person is behaving like another person (impersonating) to get access to endpoints or information that is not public.
1. vulnerability is that the user can see the session. Cookies are being read programmatically. 

Crucks lies in how we are setting the cookie -> we are going to sign it with some secret. SID : is set to true then cookies cannot be read
programmatically {Server can make a distinction between a user and between code}

samesite: request can only be sent from localhost:3000 and not sent from another website.

httponly: can't copy a user's cookie.
