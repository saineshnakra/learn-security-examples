Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
An unsecured server is susceptible to SQL injection attacks, where an attacker can introduce SQL 
commands through parameters, leading to unauthorized database information disclosure. To counteract this, 
the improved server version enhances security by verifying that all user inputs are strings and then cleansing these
 inputs to eliminate any special characters that could be used to construct a SQL command.
