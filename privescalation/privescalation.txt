Privilege escalation occurs when there's a lack of proper authorization checks or flaws in the system's implementation, 
allowing users to gain access to resources or perform actions beyond their permitted level. To mitigate this risk, secure
 coding practices involve establishing a unique session for each authentication process. This means if a user has previously authenticated, 
 a session is already in place to track their permissions.

To further enhance security and prevent such vulnerabilities, it's crucial to implement measures that safeguard against session spoofing. 
This can be achieved by configuring cookies to be HTTP-only and enforcing cross-site request restrictions by setting the SameSite attribute 
to true. Despite these precautions, sessions can still be compromised, leading to potential spoofing. A robust method to counteract this risk
 is through the use of authentication tokens and two-factor authentication (2FA), adding an extra layer of security against unauthorized access.
